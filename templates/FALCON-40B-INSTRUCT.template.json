It was built using custom-built tooling for data pre-processing and model training built on Amazon SageMaker. As of June 6, 2023, it is the best open-source model currently available. Falcon-40B outperforms LLaMA, StableLM, RedPajama, MPT, etc. To see comparison, see OpenLLM Leaderboard. It features an architecture optimized for inference, with FlashAttention and multiquery.", "payload": {"parameters": {"maxTokens": {"default": 5, "range": [1, 500]}, "temperature": {"default": 0.5, "range": [0.0, 1.0]}}}}
